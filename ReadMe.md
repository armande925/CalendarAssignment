Calendar Assignment

Create a dynamic scheduling application that stores data to local storage

::INTRO::

During this project I was really struck by the use of local.storage and the ability to house data in what is essentially a local based cloud. To access and store this data gave me a glimpse into what types of applications are possible. It drew on some of the skills that I was aware that I lacked. I attempted to make up for this by styling in a way that made its use more enjoyable to the user. All in all i was attempting to continue with a theme that was playful yet met the requirements of the assignment.

::ABOUT::

This assignment was completed early due to the fact that I was confused by the our weekly task in conflict with the actual week we are currently in. This isnt the end of the world because we are still going to have to complete this assignment anyway...I just have to go back to week 4 and do the code quiz now.

::THE CODE::

I was looking for a way to code the buttons that wasnt so repititious. Unfortunately I could only apply the functionality one button at a time. Styling the jumbotron was easy and sorting the color scheme was basic as well. I would have liked to style the buttons as well. Perhaps I will go back and replace them when I have a better command of the assets in cdn. There are essentially 3 sections of relevance in the javascript page. SAVE function, CLEAR function and the TIME element, which is and api based platform called "moment".
